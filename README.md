<h1>Python Keylogger Program</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this program, I learned to code a Keylogger in Python. The program records keystrokes on a computer and does so by capturing keys pressed on the keyboard. The data is logged and can be used for monitoring purposes. In the wrong hands, hackers can use this program to acquire 
personal information such as passwords and credit card information.
